install astroboy.tsyarn add astroboy.ts接入说明\n1. 按照 astroboy 框架要求创建应用程序目录（略）\n2. 调整 app.ts\nimport path from \"path\";\nimport { Server, Astroboy } from \"astroboy.ts\";\n\nServer.Create(Astroboy, {\n  ROOT_PATH: path.resolve(__dirname, \"..\")\n}).run({\n  onStart: () => console.log(\"hello world!\"),\n  onError: err => console.log(`oh shit : ${String(err)}`)\n});3. 配置初始化中间件\n\napp/middleware/server-init.ts\n\nimport { serverInit } from \"astroboy.ts\";\n\nexport = () => serverInit;\nconfig/middleware.default.js\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  \"server-init\": {\n    priority: 0.1,\n    enable: true\n  }\n};\nconfig/config.default.js\n\n/**\n * 默认配置文件\n */\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  \"@astroboy.ts\": {\n    showTrace: false,\n    diType: \"proxy\"\n  }\n};4. 启动\n# 本地安装astrpboy.ts\n./node_modules/.bin/atc dev --inspect --tsconfig app/tsconfig.json\n# 全局装过astrpboy.ts\natc dev --inspect --tsconfig app/tsconfig.json开发姿势\n0.cli 配置文件\nastroboy.ts 开放了一个配置文件，用来简化 cli 参数的使用，类似 webpack，可以使用--config 参数修改配置文件的名字。\n\natc.config.js - 一个简单的配置文件\n\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  tsconfig: \"tsconfig.json\",\n  inspect: true,\n  typeCheck: true,\n  transpile: true,\n  debug: \"*\",\n  mock: \"http://127.0.0.1:8001\",\n  // atc router 的命令配置\n  routers: {\n    enabled: true,\n    always: false,\n    approot:

path.join(__dirname, \"plugins/**/*.*\")\n  ],\n  // 忽略的文件列表\n  ignore: []\n};1.编写路由控制器\n控制器方面使用装饰器来定制 Router 的业务层级，确定 Route 的 url 和 method，提供 params 和 body 的注入获取能力，并抽象了响应中 body 的写入能力。\n\napp/controllers/test.ts\n\nimport {\n  Controller,\n  Configs,\n  AstroboyContext,\n  ENV,\n  JsonResult,\n  GET,\n  POST,\n  FromParams,\n  FromBody,\n  Deserialize,\n  IContext\n} from \"astroboy.ts\";\n\ninterface GetQuery {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  type: string;\n}\n\ninterface PostData {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n}\n\n@Controller(\"test\")\nclass TestController {\n  // 构造函数注入能力\n  constructor(\n    private configs: Configs,\n    private base: AstroboyContext\n  ) {}\n\n  // GET: {项目前缀}/api/test/testGet/:type?id=xxxx&name=xxxx\n  @GET(\"testGet/:type\")\n  // 显式进行params参数前提，作为路由方法参数\n  // 使用接口为了更好的类型描述，不会进行任何运行时类型处理\n  public methodGet(@FromParams() params: GetQuery) {\n    const { ctx } = this.base;\n    const { id, name, type } = params;\n    ctx.type = \"application/json\";\n    // JsonResult实现了IResult接口，提供将json内容编程化写入body的能力，同时提供了Configs容器的配置化支持\n    // 你可以自己实现自定义逻辑，只要实现IResult接口即可\n    return new JsonResult({\n      id,\n      name,\n      type,\n      url: ctx.url\n    });\n  }\n\n  // POST: {项目前缀}/api/post/:type?id=xxxx&name=xxxx\n  @POST(\"post/:type\")\n  // body也能进行相似的流程实现参数前提\n  // 你仍然可以进行直接解构\n  public async methodPost(\n    @FromParams() params: GetQuery,\n    @FromBody() { id, name }: PostData\n  ) {\n    const { name, id: id2, type } = params;\n    return new JsonResult({\n      id,\n      name,\n      type,\n      id2,\n      name\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nexport = TestController;到此一个业务路由层级的构建并没有完成，和原生 astroboy 开发类似，相应的需要一个 router 文件来创建 astroboy 的 router 数组定义。\n\napp/routers/test.ts\n\nimport TEST from \"../controllers/test\";\nimport { buildRouter } from \"astroboy.ts\";\n\n// “test”代表controllers内的文件级别\n// “/v1”代表应用的路由前缀，这里只作为示例\nexport = buildRouter(TEST, \"test\", \"/v1\");\n注：1.0.1-rc.27 版本以后已经支持自动生成 router，不需再要上述步骤，有两种模式任选其一，操作如下：\n\n1. routers 预处理模式\n\n使用 astroboy.ts 提供的命令行工具\n\n# 在开发启动或者生产打包前确保执行即可\n./node_modules/.bin/atc router --always --filetype ts2. 动态初始化(不推荐)\n\n配置 app/app.ts 文件 (但是在删除控制器后，需要手动删除 routers 中多余的文件)\n\nServer.Create(..., {\n  ...\n})\n  .option(ROUTER_OPTIONS, { appRoot: \"/v1\", enabled: true })\n  ...到此一个完整的业务级别的 router 构造完成了。\n2.编写可注入服务\nastroboy.ts 按照 IoC 模式的指导思路进行设计，所有的服务都应该按照 DI 的方式（无论是手动还是自动）获取、组装和构造逻辑层级。\n\napp/services/test.ts\n\nimport { Injectable } from \"astroboy.ts\";\n\n@Injectable()\nclass TestService {\n  private value = 98765;\n\n  public add(v: number) {\n    this.value += v;\n  }\n\n  public showValue() {\n    return this.value;\n  }\n}\n\nexport = TestService;astroboy.ts 服务的默认行为是范围单例（scoped），简单的描述来说，一个服务在同一个请求流程中总是保持单例状态，并在请求结束后释放。scoped 服务可以在请求流程中的任意位置获取，并承担数据传输载体的职责。\n你当然可以手动改变这一默认行为：\n// 请确保你了解type的含义，以免服务出现不符合预期的行为\n@Injectable({ type: InjectScope.Singleton })\nclass Test02Service {\n  ...\n}其他行为：\n\nnew（每次获取总是创建一个全新的对象）\nsingleton（在整个应用中保持唯一并积累副作用）\n\n服务还具有其他高级功能（包括依赖注入分离和实现多重继承），这里不一一展开了。\n3.对接 astroboy 的配置\n创建接口来描述 astroboy 的配置中的各个业务部分：\n\nconfig/options/demo.ts\n\nimport { createConfig } from \"astroboy.ts\";\n\ninterface DemoOptions {\n  /** ccccc */\n  key01: number;\n  key02: string;\n}\n\nexport const DEMO_OPTIONS = createConfig(\"demo\");\nconfig/config.default.js\n\n/**\n * 默认配置文件\n */\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  \"@astroboy.ts\": {\n    showTrace: true,\n    diType: \"proxy\"\n  },\n\n  demo: {\n    key01: 12345,\n    key02: \"woshinidie\"\n  },\n\n  strOpt: \"test_string_config\"\n};这样既可以更好的描述原本混乱的 config 文件，同时可以在对 config 访问的时候提供定义支持。\n// 注入Configs服务，然后获取配置\n// opts变量将会被正确的绑定上类型信息\nconst opts = this.configs.get(DEMO_OPTIONS);4.在中间件中使用依赖注入\n过程比较轻量，废话不多，直接上 demo：\n\napp/middlewares/demo.ts\n\nimport { injectScope, ENV, Context } from \"astroboy.ts\";\nimport DataService from \"../services/Data\";\n\nexport = () =>\n  injectScope(async ({ injector, configs, ctx, next }) => {\n    // console.log(configs.get(ENV).showTrace);\n    const data = injector.get(DataService);\n    data.setStamp(new Date().getTime());\n    await next();\n    // console.log(\"fuck\");\n  });\n文档完善中...\n\n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 NODE.Mogician
